        <h3>Main facts of Tim Berners-Lee's life:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - Born in London, England.</li>
            <li><strong>1976</strong> - Received a first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics from Queen's College at Oxford University, England. While there he made his first computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.</li>
            <li><strong>1978</strong> - Joined D.G.Nash Ltd (Ferndown, Dorset, UK) where he helped to create type-setting software for intelligent printers, and a multitasking operating system.</li>
            <li><strong>1980</strong> - Worked for a few months as an independent consultant at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. While there he wrote for his own private use his first program for storing information including using random associations. Named "Enquire" and never published, this program formed the conceptual basis for the future development of the World Wide Web.</li>
            <li><strong>1981</strong> - Worked at John Poole's Image Computer Systems Ltd (Bournemouth, Dorset, UK), with technical design responsibility. Work here included real-time control firmware, graphics and communication software, and a generic macro language. This gave him experience in computer networking.</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - Took up a fellowship at CERN to work on distributed real-time systems for scientific data acquisition and system control. When CERN became the largest internet node in Europe Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>1989</strong> - Proposed a global hipertext project, to be known as the World Wide Web. Based on the earlier "Enquire" work, it was designed to allow people to work together by combining their knowledge in a web of hipertext documents. He wrote the first World Wide Web server "httpd" (Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon), and the first client, "WorldWideWeb" a what-you-see-is-what-you-get hypertext browser/editor which run on the NeXTSteP operating system.</li>
            <li><strong>1990</strong> - Published the first web site which was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to start with your own website.</li>
            <li><strong>1994</strong> - Founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.</li>
            <li><strong>2004</strong> - Accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - Launched the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF). The Web Foundation is a non-profit organisation devoted to achieving a world in which all people can use the Web to communicate, collaborate and innovate freely.  The Web Foundation works to fund and coordinate efforts to defend the Open Web and further its potential to benefit humanity. </li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - Led the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI). The A4AI seeks to make internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online.</li>
            <li><strong>2018</strong> - Announced his new open-source startup Inrupt to fuel a commercial ecosystem around the Solid project, which aims to give users more control over their personal data and lets users choose where the data goes, who's allowed to see certain elements and which apps are allowed to see that data.</li>
            <li><strong>2019</strong> - At the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin Berners-Lee and the WWWF launched Contract for the Web, a campaign initiative to persuade governments, companies and citizens to commit to nine principles to stop "misuse" with the warning that "if we don't act now – and act together – to prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering its potential for good".</li>
